# CleryCrimeApp
An application to understand crime trends at the Claremont Colleges

We introduce a novel method for presenting crime and safety data to the college public. 
While the Clery Act mandates that a daily crimelog be maintained, not all constituencies know about the log or are able to easily glean relevant information from it. 
Our solution leverages online analytical processing (OLAP) to answer multi-dimensional analytical queries about crime and safety in and around the Claremont Colleges as they are posed by members of the public. 

Team members: Calvin Aylward, Ethan Hardacre, Charles Shaviro, Adam Starr (project manager), and Thomas Thornton.

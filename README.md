# CleryCrimeApp
An application to understand crime trends at the Claremont Colleges created for Pomona College's CSCI133 Database course Spring 2018 under Dr. Yuqing Melanie Wu's instruction.

We introduce a novel method for presenting crime and safety data to the college public. 
While the Clery Act mandates that a daily crimelog be maintained, not all constituencies know about the log or are able to easily glean relevant information from it. 
Our solution leverages online analytical processing (OLAP) to answer multi-dimensional analytical queries about crime and safety in and around the Claremont Colleges as they are posed by members of the public. 

Team members: Calvin Aylward, Ethan Hardacre, Charles Shaviro, Adam Starr (project manager), and Thomas Thornton. 

The document [cecilsafe-overview.pdf](https://github.com/acstarr/CleryCrimeApp/blob/master/cecilsafe-overview.pdf) provides more details. 

# Nota bene: The database only has reports from Janurary 2015 to mid March 2018.
